So i recently decided to rent a VPS. In about 3 days
there have been 10,000+ attemps to login into it by bots.

I decided to write a script to see what username, ip, and port is tried the most.

The ip and port are not really that interesting by themselves. It would be interesting
to feed the ip's into a geospatial api and you get back what country and state it belonged to.
